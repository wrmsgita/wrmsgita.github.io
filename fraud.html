    <h1>Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions Using Random Forest and SMOTE</h1>

    <p>
        Fraud detection in financial transactions is a significant challenge within the banking and finance industries.
        Fraudulent activities can result in substantial losses for both companies and customers.
        Therefore, applying machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent behavior is essential for effective risk
        mitigation.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this project, I utilized the Random Forest algorithm, an ensemble method known for its capability to handle
        complex
        and imbalanced datasets. To address the common issue of class imbalance in financial transaction datasets, I
        implemented
        the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). SMOTE generates synthetic samples for the minority class
        (fraud)
        to help the model better learn patterns related to fraudulent transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>Brief Explanation of Random Forest and SMOTE</h2>
    <p>
        Random Forest can be envisioned as a collection of decision trees working together.
        Each tree makes a decision on whether a transaction is fraudulent or not based on learned rules from the
        training data.
        The final decision is determined by majority voting across all trees in the forest.
    </p>

    <p>
        SMOTE is an oversampling technique designed to handle imbalanced datasets.
        For example, in a dataset where normal transactions greatly outnumber fraudulent ones,
        SMOTE generates synthetic fraud samples to balance the dataset, allowing the model to more effectively identify
        fraud patterns.
    </p>

    <h2>Dataset and Features</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset used in this study is the Credit Card Transactions dataset, which has undergone Principal Component
        Analysis (PCA)
        to ensure customer confidentiality. The features analyzed include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> The time at which the transaction occurred, useful for detecting temporal patterns.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Amount:</strong> The transaction amount, which can be an indicator of suspicious activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Features V1 through V28:</strong> PCA-transformed variables that represent original features,
            although they lack direct interpretability.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The model learns the relationship between these features and the target label, where Class = 0 denotes normal
        transactions
        and Class = 1 denotes fraudulent transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>Analysis Process</h2>
    <p>
        First, the dataset was divided into features (X) and target labels (y) by removing the ‘Class’ column from the
        feature set.
        The data was then normalized and split into training and testing subsets.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, SMOTE was applied to balance the dataset by synthetically generating samples for the minority fraud class.

    <p>
        Subsequently, the Random Forest model was trained with regularization parameters,
        such as limiting tree depth and setting minimum sample requirements for splits and leaf nodes.
        These parameters help improve model generalization and reduce overfitting, especially after applying SMOTE.
    </p>

    <h2>Model Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
        The model was evaluated using metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to provide a
        comprehensive assessment
        in the context of imbalanced classification.
    </p>

    <p>
        The evaluation results demonstrated a high recall score, indicating strong ability to detect fraudulent
        transactions.
        However, the precision score was relatively low, suggesting that the model produced some false positives —
        normal transactions misclassified as fraud. The F1-score reflected a balance between precision and recall,
        while the high ROC-AUC score indicated the model’s effectiveness in distinguishing between the two classes.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The model performs well in detecting fraud with high sensitivity but requires further improvement to reduce
        false positives
        and enhance precision. Potential enhancements include hyperparameter tuning and techniques to improve model
        generalization,
        which could increase performance on unseen data.
