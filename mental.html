        <h1>Mental Health Sentiment Analysis using LSTM</h1>

        <p>
            The project was inspired by my observation of how people express themselves through words on social media.
            Can mental conditions be analyzed based on what they write? This question led me to explore sentiment
            analysis for mental health using a deep learning approach.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mental health diagnosis should ideally be done by professionals. However, this model can help professionals
            as a preliminary tool to detect early signs of emotional patterns from text, especially when direct
            interactions aren't available.
        </p>

        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset used is titled <strong>"Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health"</strong> from Kaggle, with 53,043
            data points and 7 distinct emotion labels. The dataset is imbalanced and requires preprocessing such as
            tokenization, stopword removal, and label encoding.

            style="width: 60%; display: block; margin: 1.5rem auto; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

        <h2>Preprocessing & Handling Class Imbalance</h2>
        <p>
            The data undergoes tokenization and is padded to fit LSTM requirements. To address imbalance, class weights
            are used to give minority classes higher influence during training.
        </p>

        <h2>Model Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The model is built using LSTM layers for textual input, and merged with a dense layer for numeric input. It
            uses categorical crossentropy for multi-class classification and softmax as the activation function in the
            final layer.

        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>
            The model achieved an accuracy of <strong>80.38%</strong> which shows potential in classifying emotions
            based on text.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This model can serve as a complementary tool for mental health professionals to analyze written expressions
            of users. Further development can include more advanced architectures or external data to improve accuracy
            and generalization.
